# Sales Data Analysis SQL Project
#### Project Objective
This project aims to discover data-driven insights that will be used to help drive frontline sales strategy, educate stakeholders, and improve the sales team's overall performance. The three key steps used to provide such insight included data collection/generation via an API and Excel, exploratory SQL analysis, and the creation of multiple Tableau dashboards.

#### Job Description
Inspiration for this project came from a job posting for a Sales Data Analyst role at Square. Square is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim Mckevely, and today they offer digital payment and financial service tools that cover a wide range of business types such as retail, food and beverage, professional services, and enterprise.

In terms of the job description, the Sales Data Analyst role at Square is looking for a professional analyst to maintain high-end reports and dashboards that will help support sales strategy analysts, educate stakeholders about the sales reporting suit, and be a frontline partner for all sales data requests by triaging, completing, and answering them. The technical skills required include experience with SQL, Salesforce, and other BI tools such as Tableau or Looker. For my project, I am practicing using SQL and Tableau to provide insights into sales performance and generate useful visualizations via reports and dashboards.

#### Data
The company names and locations I used for this project were pulled via the Cruchbase search API, details are below:

Crunchbase home page: https://www.crunchbase.com/home

API documentation: https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-api

The rest of the data was randomly generated using Excel.
The dataset contains information surrounding sales reps and high-level customer account information such as where each account is in the sales cycle, what forecast category is it under, contract price, as well as the contract start and account closed date.

#### Future Improvements
The sales data is extremely high level which makes it hard to go into more detail and limits your options in terms of what you can query for and build/ display in a dashboard. If I had more time I would improve the dataset and add more in-depth data. I would also create a mock pricing template  so that way it would be possible to do some trend analysis in terms of sales dollars. Right now the contract prices are just randomly generated numbers ranging between $1,700-$499,000.
